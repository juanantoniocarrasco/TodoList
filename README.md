# TodoList
This TodoList App is a simple application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. Tasks are stored locally using Core Data, and the user interface is built using UIKit with a pure MVC architecture.
## Technologies Used:
- UIKit: Used for building the user interface programmatically.
- Diffable Data Sources: Implemented for efficient management and display of data in UIKit interfaces.
- Core Data: Utilized for local storage and management of tasks.
## Design Patterns:
- MVC Architecture
- Delegate
- Singleton
## Features:
- Add: Users can add new lists and tasks to the list.
- Edit: Allows users to edit existing lists and tasks.
- Delete: Enables users to delete lists or tasks they no longer need.
- Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed.
## Notes:
This app serves as a foundational example of using UIKit and Core Data with a pure MVC architecture, augmented with Diffable Data Sources for improved data handling. It's designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for learning about these technologies.
